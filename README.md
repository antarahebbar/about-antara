# about-antara
Welcome to my personal website where you can learn about my hobbies, projects, and travel! This repo contains a project where I was able to explore HTML, CSS, and JS for the first time. The front-end was designed without the use of libraries for the purpose of learning these languages. The website is deployed via GitHub pages! 

## Features
Here are some of the skills I learned through this project.

- DOM structure
- Sucessful navigation bar across 3 pages
- Implementing best accessibility practices (keyboard and screenreader access)
- Reactive media queries (different stying on 3 sizes)
- Interactivity through JS features, e.g. on click and on hover functions
- Scrollable image divs

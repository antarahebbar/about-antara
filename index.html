    <h1> Antara Hebbar's Personal Page </h1>
    <p> Welcome to my personal page, where you can learn about my projects, interests, and hobbies! </p>

    <h2> Quick Introduction </h2>
    <div class = "Profle" > 
        <p>Hi! I'm a student at the University of Michigan pursuing a BSE in Computer Science and a minor in business. I'm interested in creating tech solutions to business issues, especially when they involve machine learning or data analytics. I'm a problem-solver, someone who values creativity and team work. I spent my last summer in Paris, completing a study abroad program for engineers. Before that, I completed a Disease Classification and a Lyric-based classification project. Outside of professional interests, I love to hike, play the piano, and explore new places.</p>
